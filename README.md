# DH-project-2: a map of linguistic conferences

The map itself can be found here: [The Resultâ„¢](). For the details see [the description]().
We took the data from [linguistlist.org](https://linguistlist.org/callconf/browse-current.cfm?type=Conf).
> Currently, only 2018-2019 conferences all over the world are available.
