# DH-project-2: a map of linguistic conferences

The map itself can be found here: [The Resultâ„¢](). For the details see [the description]().
We took the data from [linguistlist.org](https://linguistlist.org/callconf/browse-current.cfm?type=Conf).
> Currently, only 2018-2019 conferences all over the world are available.

## How did we do it?

step|notes
:---|:---
Find a list of conferences|
Get names, places and dates| [code](/code)
Make a csv| [updated 13.12.2018 12:30](/output)
Transform places to coordinates| not needed
Some data managment| 250 lines, selected randomly
Create a map in ArcGis| couple different versions
Do some dEsIgN| user VS analysis
Fill in all the info|

## What does the map show?
America and Europe are pretty crowded with conferences.

## Further work
+ Make it updatable
+ Add some more information like *language, field, call for papers deadline, etc*.
+ Create a bot for TG (to make it handy).
