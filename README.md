**Our  presentation from 15.12.2018 can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mFT9Dup5V5k8-6HbAY2NY8RT_F1tXFuZLN7mDAYItyA/edit?usp=sharing).**

The map itself can be found here: [The Result™](https://arcg.is/1uWe5z). For the details see [the description](https://arcg.is/0bXO10).

We took the data from [linguistlist.org](https://linguistlist.org/callconf/browse-current.cfm?type=Conf).
> Currently, only 2018-2019 conferences all over the world are available.
